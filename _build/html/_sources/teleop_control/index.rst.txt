Overview
********

This package is used to control the robot's arm, deposition, and drive systems using xbox controllers. 
One controller is used to control the robot's arm and deposition system while a seperate controller is used
to control the drive system. 

:code:`arm.launch.py` launches a joy node for the arm and the :code:`arm_publisher` node that subscribes to the joy node
and publishes a motor control message for each of the arm motors.
:code:`drive.launch.py` launches a joy node for the drive system and the :code:`drive_publisher` node that subscribes to the
joy node and publishes a motor control message for each of the 4 motors for the drive system. 

.. note::
    These launch files only launch the joystick related nodes, and will not result in the robot moving

In order to actually move the robot, we need to launch the nodes for the arm and drive and the associated ros_phoenix nodes to subscribe to the motor control topics.
Launch :code:`full_arm_launch.xml` and :code:`full_drive_launch.xml` which include both the teleop launch 
files and the ros_phoenix launch files for the specific system.
