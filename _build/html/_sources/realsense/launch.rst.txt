Instructions for Realsense Package Launch

The goal of this package is to be able to run SLAM on an Intel Realsense D435i. This process requires 3 primary nodes.

1. Realsense Node: The node should be able to take in Realsense data and output the color and depth image to the proper topics.
2. Rtabmap Node: The node reads in the color and depth image from the Realsense node and can create a map of the environment, a localization pose (and transform map->odom), and an odometry pose (and transform odom->base_link).
3. Transform Node: Currently, the only transforms published are the localization (map->odom), odometry (odom->base_link), and camera transforms (camera_link-> <camera_frames>). In order to connect these trees, a static transform (base_link -> camera_link) must be published such that the camera_link represents the camera pose and base_link represents the pose for the center of the robot.

.. warning::
    Before running the rtabmap node, you must install it from source.

To verify that it works, run rviz2 and add the /map topic and the coordinate frames map, odom and base_link to the display. You should see an accurate costmap of the environment and the base_link camera moving based on the actual Realsense movement.
