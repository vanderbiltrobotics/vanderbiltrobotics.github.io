Visual Studio Code
******************

Visual Studio Code is the primary IDE we use and it has lots of plugins that help us out. If you haven't install VS Code (different than Visual Studio)
please go do so.

Once you have VS Code installed, you should install the following extensions:

- C/C++ from Microsoft
- Python from Microsoft
- ROS from Microsoft
- Git Graph from mhutchie (optional but useful for seeing how all the branches are connected)
