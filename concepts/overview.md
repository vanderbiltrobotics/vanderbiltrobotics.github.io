# Overview
The purpose of this section of documentation is to provide an introduction to robotics topics we use everyday. 
Each article will try to give a simplified explanation of the topic and why it matters to us, while providing further
reading and learning resources. 

If you have a certain way of explaining a topic that might help add a sense of intuition, please add it to the docs, even if you aren't 100% sure about the accuracy of the explanation. The goal of these documents is to give people the intuition for these important concepts so they can discuss them with the team and learn the exact details on their own.
