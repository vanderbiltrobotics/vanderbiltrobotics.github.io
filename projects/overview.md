# Overview
The best way to learn ROS2 is by doing so we have put together a series of mini projects that will introduce you to the important parts of ROS2 and the `lunabot-ros2` repo that we use in our day to day. 

A common goal amongst the mini-projects is getting you comfortable using google and our internal documentation for troubleshooting so we might not provide as much advice as normal since we want to see what you can do!

## Start
1. Read through the getting started documentation.
2. Install ROS2 on your system
3. Create a ROS2 workspace and clone the `lunabot-ros2` repo into it (instructions in the installation docs)
4. Create a new branch from `main` using `git checkout -b intro/<your-name>`
5. Complete projects 1, 2, and 3
