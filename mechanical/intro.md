# Intro to Mechanical Documentation
This document provides a high level overview of how to complete documentation for the mechanical team. 

## Resources
Each system should have background resources to facilitate brainstorming, generate inspiration, and support design decisions. Resources should be added with the following method:

1. Link to resource
2. Summary of resource
3. Key points of useful information
4. Which subsystem the resource is most relevant for

## Design Specs
The overall design and every piece of hardware should have a justification. This section is for documenting motor specs, sensor specs, dimensions, design spec requirements, etc. Each spec should also have a short justification for why it was chosen to asist in educating future members about how to make their design decisions.
